# Delete old packages

Github action for deleting old versions of packages in the Github package registry.

This is very similar to [actions/delete-package-versions](https://github.com/actions/delete-package-versions)
but targets a different use case.

The action works by getting at most 20 packages with at most the oldest 100 versions of each, applying the filters (see
table below) on them and then deleting the matching versions.

> If you have more than 100 versions and none of the 100 oldest versions match, no packages will be deleted!
